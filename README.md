# TicTacToeAI
A Tic-Tac-Toe game against the computer. The game uses predictive AI to calculate your chance of winning, your chance of 
losing and the chance of a draw with each move you make. The AI does so by creating a tree of all possible moves and calculating 
the probabilities based on the number of winning leaves, losing leaves and draw leaves existing in the tree. The AI also uses these probabilities to make informed decisions while playing.
